    description:
      "This is to ensure we are attracting those who are serious with this project and what it stands for. We recognize the minting price is high, but we have a limited supply of 2,500 in the collection. If we were to increase the supply, the payouts at the end of the year would decrease significantly.",

    description:
      "Yes! Each coin gets a specific pay out per the utilities, so if you have a couple of each, you will still get all the respected amounts!",

    title: "How will we know what is in the community wallet?",
    description:
      "The community wallet balance will always be displayed in our discord. One thing to note is that you would be able to know what your payout is at that given time, so you would essentially know what your NFT coin is worth if you wanted to list it. Example: Say one month after minting is completed you have a black coin NFT and the wallet is at $500K. That would tell me that with the utilities of the black coin pay out, you would split 5% of the community wallet with the other holder resulting in $12,500 at that point in time. So, if you wanted to list it, you know you could list it at $12,500 A buyer could potentially see where its current value is and want to buy and keep it for the remaining of the year for the payout. Not to mention, as ETH increases, so does the community wallet!",
